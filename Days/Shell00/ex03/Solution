//Firstly , we'll create two directories & three files

mkdir test{0,2}
touch test{1,3,4}
//in the exercise you see test5 & test6 which i'm not creating yet , cause its not a normal (files/directories)
//test6 is Soft link point to test0 directory.
//test5 is Hard link point to test3 file.
//Soft Link (Symbolic Link): A pointer or shortcut to the original file or directory. If the original file is deleted, the soft link becomes broken and inaccessible.
//Hard Link: A direct reference to the physical data on the disk. Both the hard link and the original file share the same data, so if the original is deleted, the hard link still provides access to the data.

ln test3 test5
ln -s test0 test6
