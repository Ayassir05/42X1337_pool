find . -type f \( -name "*~" -o -name "#*#" \) -print -exec rm {} \;

find .:
        find: A command used to search for files and directories.
        .: Indicates that the search should start from the current directory and include all its subdirectories.

-type f:
        Specifies that the find command should look for files only (not directories).
        
\( and \):
        Grouping operators to combine conditions. The backslashes (\) are used to escape the parentheses so that the shell doesn t interpret them incorrectly.
        
-name "*~":
        Searches for files whose names end with ~. These are often temporary or backup files created by text editors.

-o:
        Logical OR operator. This means that if either condition on its sides is true, the file will match.

-name "#*#":
        Searches for files whose names start and end with #. These files are also temporary files typically created by text editors (e.g., Emacs).

-print:
        Prints the path of each file found that matches the conditions.

-exec rm {} \;:
        -exec: Executes a command on each file found.
        rm: The command to remove/delete a file.
        {}: Placeholder for the current file found by find.
        \;: Indicates the end of the -exec command. The backslash escapes the semicolon so the shell reads it correctly.
