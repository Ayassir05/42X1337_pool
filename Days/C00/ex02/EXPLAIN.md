**The prototype void function(void);**
in C or C++ has two uses of the void keyword, and each has a specific meaning. Here's a breakdown:

1. First void (Return Type):
* Meaning: The function print does not return any value.

Why: This tells the compiler and anyone reading the code that the function performs an action (like printing something) but does not produce a result that can be used in an expression.

Example:

```C

void print(void) {
    printf("This function does not return anything.\n");
}
```
Here, print simply prints a message and does not return any value.

2. Second void (Parameter List):
* Meaning: The function print takes no arguments.

* Why: This explicitly states that the function does not accept any parameters. If you try to pass arguments to this function, the compiler will throw an error.

# Example:

```C
void print(void) {
    printf("No arguments are allowed here.\n");
}
```
If you try to call print(10) or print("hello"), the compiler will reject it because the function is declared to take no arguments.

**Why Use void in This Context?**
_ Clarity: Using void in the parameter list makes it clear that the function does not expect any input.

_ Safety: It prevents accidental passing of arguments, which could lead to bugs or unexpected behavior.

_ Standard Practice: In C, using void in the parameter list is the standard way to declare a function that takes no arguments. Without void, the function would allow any number of arguments (in older C standards), which can be unsafe.

**Example Usage:**
```C
#include <stdio.h>

// Function prototype
void print(void);

int main() {
    print(); // Correct usage
    // print(10); // This would cause a compiler error
    return 0;
}

// Function definition
void print(void) {
    printf("This function takes no arguments and returns nothing.\n");
}
```
# Summary:
_ void as the return type: The function does not return a value.

_ void in the parameter list: The function does not accept any arguments.

_ Why use void: For clarity, safety, and to adhere to standard practices in C/C++.

_ This prototype ensures that print is a function that neither takes input nor returns output, making its behavior explicit and predictable.
